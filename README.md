# ExodusBot-Public
This is the public edition of my discord bot. Some code has been obfuscated and some has been removed altogether.

List of commands:

Archive: Archives messages (removes messages from main channel and sends them to the archive channel)

GiveSpecial: Adds user to list of users with the "special" permission. This lets them see secret channels

Memebigboy: this ones just a meme

Move: Moves messages to desired channel

Music: In progress. Theoretically would play music into a channel from youtube and soundcloud links

Purge: For filtering out spam or bot messages and moving video links to the videos channel

Random: Generates random outcomes (picks a level to play on, picks a game to play, rolls dice)

Soup: sends a comic to the chat

Truepurge: Deletes X messages

Voice Play: Tells the bot to join a voice channel

Webscrape: Uses Cheerio and Request to scrape image boards for images, and sends them to the channel.

Whohas: Designed to find out who has a certain permission. Unfortunately this is broken for now.
